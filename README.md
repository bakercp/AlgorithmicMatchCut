# AlgorithmicMatchCut

This is a collection of openFrameworks applications that I have been using to attempt to create an application that will algorithmically graphic match cut to and from videos. At the moment I am using 43 videos I've hand-picked from youTube. I will update this readme when I have finished the project.

The media used in these apps are in [a separate download on my google drive](https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B882vM4ru7ftb2hxdm5KT25ObFE&usp=sharing). The folder `scaledMp4s` is meant to go into the `flow-imageSequences/bin/data folder`, and the folder `imageSequences` is meant to go in the `tSNEImageCoordinates/bin/data` folder.
