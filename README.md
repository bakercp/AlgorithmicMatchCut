# AlgorithmicMatchCut

This is a collection of openFrameworks applications that I have been using to attempt to create an application that will algorithmically graphic match cut to and from videos. At the moment I am using 43 videos I've hand-picked from youTube. I will update this readme when I have finished the project.
